# This code was created by Kara Sumpter
# For implementation I created functions based
# on what was solved out by hand for the Greens Function,
# Homogeneous Equations, and using Undetermined Coefficients.
# The functions were then graphed on subplots, as well as graphed
# together to compare the values that were given.
